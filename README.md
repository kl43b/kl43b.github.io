This project contains my 2021 submission for 3b1b's [Summer Of Math Exposition](https://3b1b.co/some1). I live outside so...everything takes longer; but I'll update this when I can.

1. [Lost In Translation: Moving The Locator](LocatorMoves.html)

**Note to contest reviewers: Only item 1 was ready by the deadline.**

**BELOW:** Continuing research note uploads.

2. This is work-in-process / I have to smooth out terminology *(it's here because even partial work may be useful if something happens / I can't finish)* 

[Calculus Extension to differentiation + new generalized quadratic/cubic equations](GeneralQuadCubic.html) : Using PT and locator, we can "cast" groups of roots to any other root group, generally regardless of the polynomial degree. **Also included:** Generalized Quadratic and Cubic Equations (for any degree). 

Desmos demos: [generalized quadratic](/desmos/general_quadratic.html) / [generalized cubic](/desmos/general_cubic.html)

3. Expanded locator insights next, e.g., The Locator Line
