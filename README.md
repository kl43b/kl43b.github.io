This project contains my 2021 submission for 3b1b's [Summer Of Math Exposition](https://3b1b.co/some1). 

I live outside so...everything takes longer; but I'll update this when I can.

1. [Lost In Translation: Moving The Locator](LocatorMoves.html)

**Note to contest reviewers: Only item 1 was ready by the deadline.**

---
**BELOW:** Continuing research notes.

2. This is not explainer-level yet; it's under construction and I obviously have to work on terminology *(it's just here because even partial work may be useful if something happens / I can't finish)* 

[Calculus Extension to Derivatives and general quadratic/cubic equations](GeneralQuadCubic.html) Using PT and locator, we can "cast" groups of roots to any other root group, generally regardless of the polynomial degree. **Also included:** Generalized Quadratic and Cubic Equations (for any degree). Desmos [demo: general quadratic](/desmos/general_quadratic.html) [demo: general cubic](/desmos/general_cubic.html)

3. Expand / make easier item 1
4.
