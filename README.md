This project contains my 2021 submission for 3b1b's [Summer Of Math Exposition](https://3b1b.co/some1). 

I live outside so...everything takes longer; but I'll update this when I can.

1. [Lost In Translation: Moving The Locator](LocatorMoves.html)

**Note to reviewers:** Only item 1 was ready by the deadline.
I will continue adding content because there's a lot more to add, but any additional pages linked here were after the 2021-08-22 deadline.
